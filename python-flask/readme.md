# Wine Quality Predictor
## Introduction
Now a days quality is important on every buying product and eating items and Here we predict the quality of the wine and in process of finding the quality of wine we make use of machine learning algorithms. There are many types of machine learning algorithms any algorithm will comes under the category of either supervised or unsupervised machine learning algorithms
## Algorithms
We will work on the algorithms and choose the algorithm that gives best accuracy or high accuracy. That we build a model by the help of algorithm that take's input and gives the output.
### The Algorithms we build is
Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier algorithm
KNeighborsClassifier
Gaussian Navies Bayes
#### Working of Algorithm
When working with algorithms we come up with two terms called train and test.
1. The data in the dataset will be partitioned into two sets called as train and test data.
1. Firstly algorithm will  get's trained with the data, and the data used for trained is called as **train data**.
1. Step-3:The data that  left that which was not chosen as train data is called **test data**.
  1. Now the test data will be given to  the model to determine the accuracy of the data, the test data will not contain the target attribute which the   model returns that as output.
## Pickle
 Pickle in Python is primarily used in serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure. In other words, it's the process of converting a Python object into a byte stream to store it in a file/database, maintain program state across sessions, or transport data over the network.
